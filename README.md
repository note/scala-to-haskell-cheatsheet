# From Scala to Haskell Cheat Sheet

Site: https://note.github.io/scala-to-haskell-cheatsheet/

Heavily inspired by [From Java to Kotlin](https://github.com/fabiomsr/from-java-to-kotlin).

## The goal of the project

This project aims to provide a succint "mapping" from Scala to Haskell. It's a thing that can be useful to have next to the main screen to glance at while not being sure 
about specific construct. Similarly to any of X-to-Y mappings it's fated to be oversimplified.

## Status

It is an early work in progress. There are many apparent lacking bits like pattern matching, tuples, maps, debugging (tracking, printing), etc.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome.
